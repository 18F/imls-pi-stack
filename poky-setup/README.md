# Yocto/Poky bootstrapping script

`bootstrap.sh` is meant to be run inside Ubuntu.

This bootstrap script builds off the Poky `honister` branch (supported until May 2022) and adds the meta-raspberry layer with some custom tweaks. This is a stable configuration setup that will allow one to build `core-image-minimal` for testing purposes.
